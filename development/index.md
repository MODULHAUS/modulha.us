# Modular software, modular development

The agents of Modulhaus brought ancient software techniques back into style.  Now, the world is contributing to a great module system, piece by piece, creating reusable components.  These components make up a large portion of your application.  

Modulhaus provides architecture and development services, using modular style, and the library of open source code known so well to us.  We decompose your application into a blueprint of extant and missing components.  The missing modules and gluecode are written to spec and tested.

We are currently accepting contract proposals.  To submit a request, describe what you require of your application or system [here](/contact).

## Meta Architecture

"Many hands make a light load." So said the Sage of Distribution.

The modular pattern for development is the Unix Style, and reinvented by the Node.js community.  Reusable, open-source components abound. If you are not building web applications in this style, you are working to hard.  Programming work is expensive.

Programmers are expensive.  Clositered coders create a mess.  Raising and maintaining a stable of them requires high level management.  And, as we observe even in the enteprise programming, great things can be build by distributed labor.

What happens when you apply the modular style and distributed effort to the labor that creates the work?  You create a global, scalable labor force, working together from technical niches.  To utlitize this potential, you need experienced open source librarians with a network of same.  And, well, you're already here.
