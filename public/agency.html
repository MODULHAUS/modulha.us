<h3 id="what-is-it-good-for-">What is it good for?</h3>
<p>Modulhaus has some ideas about representing creative, open source hackers.  That is because we are trying to solve our own problems.  </p>
<p>Representation may take many forms:  matching sponsors, crowdfund campaigning, teaching or speaking engagements, contract negotiations, and, yes, even job placement.  We are open to all kinds of opportunities. All depends upon our interests.</p>
<p>But first, let us clear the air of mass marketing’s appropriation of an important concept.  Then we can breathe it in, the conceptual air.</p>
<h3 id="-talent-agency-is-an-oxymoron-">“Talent Agency” is an oxymoron.</h3>
<p>The word “agency” has long been usurped by those business entities which, supposedly, represent talent.  But what they are really doing is owning that talent, hiding it behind a process, and internally atomizing it for bottom line efficiencies.  </p>
<p>The “talent” are often people who are creative, experimental, artistic, and selling their own agency, because they have to, or because the enjoy having money.</p>
<p>Your motives are your own, and that is what should be represented.  We’re only here to take the power, and put it back where it belongs.</p>
<p>We want things to work differently for hackers like us.  The agency we posess is great.  Our potential is growing, as the web we build grows.  No pseudo-agency can pretend to actually represent it without understanding what we do, and why we do it.  </p>
<h3 id="agent-agent-of-the-agency-agency">Agent Agent, of the Agency Agency</h3>
<p>When we use the word “agency”, we are referring to the thing itself.  At modulhaus, agency is all the knowledge and abilities we posess to design and build awesome applications, now and with what we may well guess about the future.  Agency is the thing itself.  We put the energy there.  We’ve got the power. </p>
<p>Therefore, in our vernacular, “Agents” are people who possess that agency… not the resellers of it.  We are our own agents.  And as crafters of an open source web, we might could be each other’s.  </p>
<h2 id="ideate">Ideate</h2>
<p>How can we make this work for each other?  We encourage your input. We have some of our own for your consideration.  Call them guiding principles.  </p>
<p>Rerpesentation must always be of the hacker’s interests.  This applies no matter what that interest is.  Some hackers want to work on public projects, and may seek funding and sponsorship.  Others may seek a representative for contract negotiation, or finding the a good job with the right company.</p>
<p>Representation must never be expoitative.  This is exactly the case with recruiters, who pit talent against companies, for their profit is in that margin.</p>
<p>We’re all open source.  We are distributed.  We are out in the world making contact with future shit.  Might agents represent each other, when opportunities arise?  If we are actively looking out for the interest of our own, representing others a la mode The Golden Rule,  we create a currency that belongs to us.  As the currency grows, so does the reach and power of open source agency.</p>
<p>Plus, there is one thing that is undeniable about reprentation:  it is far easier to talk somebody else up than yourself.  It is the primary reason for seeking representation in the first place:  to have somebody else toot your horn.</p>
