<p>Modulhaus offers affordable web development for any project.  We use a vast library of open soure code to liberate the design of applications from proprietary molds.  Our modular development style is the ultimate in efficiency.  The benfit is yours.</p>
<p>We are a network of independent, collaborative code writers.  Together, our diversity covers the entire domain of web development, from content to crypto.  Distributed, we are a 24 hour, scalable laborforce.</p>
<p>We offer development on any level, from the full stack down to the individual module.  No application is too small, nor too large.  We specialize in interactive web experiences, tools, and interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="agency">Agency</h2>
<p>Indpendent, open source hackers posess their own agency.  We are the code writers.  We grok the complex of modules and APIs.  We follow certain principles which allow us to collaborate and  write interoperative programs, without interoperative project managers.  </p>
<p>Modulhaus exists to promote and enable the work of open source hackers, whether through contracts and negotiations, or as a representative of your interests.  To that end, we are exploring all kinds of ways to support people and projects.  </p>
<p>If you are seeking modular contract work, or wish to explore other options, reach through the nets to contact us, and/or <a href="#signup">tell us about it</a>.</p>
<h2 id="operatives">Operatives</h2>
<p>Modulhaus is an Idea as a Service, which we intend to continue developing until it runs itself on independent, decentralized people power.  Until then, Modulahuas and everything it represents is being fronted by its consiprators @substack and @johnnyscript.  You know where to find us.  </p>
<h3 id="james-halliday">James Halliday</h3>
<p>James is well known as a prolific author of open source applications, and as an international ambassador for all programs modular, open source, and javascript.  Yet, James is ahead of his own technically edgy persona.  The web of his schemes are as local as global, as personal as robotic.  What is he planning to build with all of those modules?</p>
<h3 id="johnny-honestly">Johnny Honestly</h3>
<p>What can be said about Johnny?  He appears to know what he is doing.  Thatâ€™s discouraging.  He brings a lot of problems to application development, from experience in community, cultural, and entreprenuerial labors.  He designs to bring novel solutions and creative hacks back the other way.</p>
