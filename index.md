##  Open Source Development

Modulhaus offers affordable web development for any project.  We use a vast library of open soure code to liberate the design of applications from stiff frameworks and proprietary molds.  Our modular development style is the ultimate in efficiency.  The benfit is yours.

Modulhaus represents a network of independent, collaborative code writers.  Collectively, our diversity covers the entire domain of web development, from content to crypto (and back).  Distributed, we are a 24 hour, scalable laborforce.

We offer development on any level, from the full stack down to the individual module.  No application is too small, nor too large, and we dig complexity.  We specialize in interactive web experiences, networks, tools, and interfaces.

To get started, send us a [work proposal](#contact).

##  Agency

Indpendent, open source hackers posess their own agency.  We are the code writers.  We grok the complex of modules and APIs.  We follow certain principles which allow us to collaborate and  write interoperative programs, without interoperative project managers, recruiters, and HR buffers.  

Modulhaus exists to promote and enable the work of open source hackers, whether through contracts and negotiations, or as a representative of your interests.  To that end, we are exploring all kinds of ways to support people and projects.  

If you are seeking modular contract work, or wish to explore other options, reach through the nets to contact us, and/or [tell us about it](#signup).

##  Operatives

Modulhaus is an Idea as a Service, which we intend to continue developing until it runs itself on independent, decentralized, people power.  Until then, Modulahuas and everything it represents is being fronted by its consiprators @substack and @johnnyscript.  You know where to find us.  

### James Halliday

James is well known as a prolific author of open source applications, and as an international ambassador for all programs modular, open source, and javascript.  Yet, James is ahead of the technical edge.  The web of his schemes are as local as they are global, as real as they are virtual.  What is he planning to build with all of those modules?

###  Johnny Honestly

What can be said about Johnny?  He appears to know what he is doing.  That's discouraging.  He brings a lot of problems to application development, from experience in community, cultural, and entreprenuerial labors.  He designs to bring novel solutions and creative hacks back the other way.  He's mainly in this for the magic.
