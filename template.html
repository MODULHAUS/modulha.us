<h3 id="modular-open-source-full-stack-web-development">Modular, Open Source, Full Stack Web Development</h3>
<p>If you know what we offer, simply <a href="#input">input your application requirements</a>, and we will respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="who-">Who?</h2>
<p>Modulhaus was concieved by <a href="https://twitter.com/substack">@substack</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyscript">@johnnyscript</a> as a means for independent, open source hackers to support their practice, and an end to the hassles of software development, recruitment, and other resource wasting nonsense.  They believe the benefit will be mutual for coders and clients.</p>
<h3 id="james-halliday">James Halliday</h3>
<p><img src="substack.jpg" alt="hackety hack hack hack"></p>
<p>James is well known as a prolific author of open source applications, and as an international ambassador for all programs modular, open source, and javascript.  He is an inspiration to his peers and proteges.  </p>
<p>James is a master of distributed, full stack system architecture.  With hundreds of modules and repositories, his efforts in open source module writing and collaboration are nothing short of herculean.  </p>
<h3 id="johnny-honestly">Johnny Honestly</h3>
<p><img src="johnnyscript.jpg" alt="!longer an accurate depiction but so what"></p>
<p>Johnny Honestly knows a master style when he practices one.  He has been an completely open source hacker since age 27, when he jumped into programming and web development without the least clue what he was doing, nor how it would change the course of his life.  He has spent most of the 7 years reading code and closely following the cutting edge of web development. </p>
<p>Back then, he sensed the magic.  Today, his wizard kung foo is on point. </p>
<h2 id="what-">What?</h2>
<p>Modulhaus offers affordable web development for any project.  We use a vast library of open soure code to liberate the design of applications from stiff frameworks, unnecessary management, and expensive, proprietary molds.  Our modular development style is the ultimate in efficiency.  The benfit is yours.</p>
<p>We offer development on any level, from the full stack down to the individual module.  No application is too small, nor too large.  We eat complexity.  We specialize in interactive web experiences, networks, tools, and interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="how-">How?</h2>
<p>Open source development is as much a library science as it is programming.  We read and research endlessly.  We continually contribute code back to the stacks.  We are not alone.</p>
<p>Modulhaus represents a network of independent, collaborative code writers.  Collectively, our diversity covers the entire domain of web development, from content to crypto (and back).  Distributed, we are a 24 hour, scalable laborforce.</p>
<p><a href="#who">James and Johnny</a> serve tripply as system architects, developers, and as a nexus to this ecosystem.  If you are one of us, and want to know more, contact James or Johnny directly via IRC or other channels. </p>
<p>If you are only ineterested in getting applications built in such a sweet style, send us <a href="#input">work proposal</a>.</p>

##  Agency

Indpendent, open source hackers posess their own agency.  We are the code writers.  We grok the complex of modules and APIs.  We follow certain principles which allow us to collaborate and  write interoperative programs, without interoperative project managers, recruiters, and HR buffers.

We are the agents.  We are agents for ourselves, and for each other.<br>
Modulhaus exists to promote and enable the work of such agents, whether through contracts and negotiations, or as a representative of their interests.  To that end, we are exploring all kinds of ways to support people and projects.<br>
If you are seeking modular contract work, or wish to explore other options, reach through the nets to contact an <a href="#operators">operator</a> about becoming an agent, or thru the system:
