#  PROJECTS

Modulhaus agents are creative, independent, open source hackers.  They practice a style that has to-date spawned thousands of open source modules and applications, business, services, and games.  Our agents can spin up hosted applications that do anything the imagination can offer.   Imagine what they can imagine, who for years steadfastingly forged this complex of web technologies.  Tith thoughts on the future, we turn to some essential technologies currently in use and on the rise.

### Browserify
### scuttlebot
### games
### etc etc!

Some other facts are layed out.  Software is a medium.  It is one of the multi-media, and it is the meta-media medium.  Little need be said.  There is so much can be done.

Modulhaus agents, hackers, librarians--they go by many names.  They are artists of this craft.  They could not help but create their own way, and in their wake will be millions of style adherents and technical co-efficents.  Yet, the style masters are only getting loose, preparing for waves of innovations.

Modulhaus exists to enable this kind of talent and work.  And to that end, we believe that software can be build with different models than those currently tending.  Namely, VC backed companies which mainly pipeline into acquisitions, and a ton of expensive, wasted work.

We create software and networks for a purpose.  We envision a lot.  There is opportunity for collaboration, investment, co-production, sponsorship.  vars may vay.  

You, or somebody you know, may have ideas about applications and things, but wait to you hear ours.
