## aspiring 

You know enough to know you want to know more.  You're not so dumb as to think you should try to learn it all on your own.  And you want to give yourself a huge advantage finding a job you enjoy, and getting hired for it.

If you are not already in contact with a Modulhaus Agent, you should try to communicate with that person directly.  If you are not, it will help if you are familiar with our programs, or have attended a conference or class.  However, anybody may apply.
