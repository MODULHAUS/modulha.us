We are very interested in public works software.  There are many layers of society that have yet to be shaken up by the web and modern software.  Most municipalities, and many professional industries, are yet locked with proprietary software, with no means, on their own, of breaking free. 

What is an example of a public works project of the open source software domain?  

We've been jamming on a specific area of interest lately:  public libraries.  They all use  old, awful software, and pay a lot of money to what amounts to a monopoly on that type of system.  Monopolies are not known to push innovation and openness.  Well, we love libraries, those scrappy institutions.  They need our help!  

How do we do approach this, financially?  This is not a module, this is a system worthy of our abilities, with real users already, lots of data, and surely many hidden complications.  

We're not trying to maintain more open source projects while working contacts on the side.  We want these kind of projects to be our main.  We're not trying to Make As Much Money As Possible, either.  We know the interest is out there, and with it adequate funds.  It only needs to be organized into a collaboration among the interested parties.

We may solve the problem of funding open source, by being the Architects, and developers, of public works projects.  We have to offer what nobody asked for, explicitly--but such has never been a deterrent to advancing art and science.  The fact is, there is nobody else who can make it happen like we can.  We have to invest in it, and be optimistic that unknown crowds will stand by us, ready to speak out for their civic interests.  

We must convince the public to support projects.  How do we do this?  We try, repeatedly.  There is no shame in it.  We need to find allies in the space.  We will do everything we can up front to make a project public and inclusive.  We take that foundation to crowd, and let them be social.   

(There are also industry groups that would benefit from collaboratively funding their own software, and these groups are a natural extension of the above.)

With that, an announcement.  Modulhaus has opened new offices, in the Projects of Public Works.  We are drafting plans and planning drafts. Considerations are being made, and we will make more announcements soon.

Leave us your thoughts below.
